The file `app/(auth)/auth/forgot-password/page.tsx` still contains the following `alert()` calls that need to be replaced with `toast()` notifications:
1. `alert("Please enter your email address.");` (for empty email submission)
2. `alert(\`Error: \${data.message || response.statusText}\`);` (for API error)
3. `alert(\`An unexpected error occurred: \${error.message}\`);` (for catch block error)
