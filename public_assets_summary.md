## File Types Summary:

*   **PNG (`.png`)**: The majority of assets are in this format, typically used for graphics requiring transparency (like logos, avatars) or sharp lines.
*   **SVG (`.svg`)**: Scalable Vector Graphics, used for logos and icons that need to scale without loss of quality (`placeholder-logo.svg`, `placeholder.svg`).
*   **JPG (`.jpg`)**: Used for photographic images (`placeholder-user.jpg`, `placeholder.jpg`).

The assets in the `public/` directory provide a range of branding elements, user representations, and placeholders, crucial for frontend development and UI mockups.
