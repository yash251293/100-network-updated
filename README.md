# 100 Networks Project Status

## Project Status & Next Steps

Here's a summary of what has been accomplished so far:

*   Initial project analysis completed.
*   Project cleanup (backup files removed, CSS consolidated).
*   ThemeProvider integrated for theme management.
*   Core TypeScript Data Models defined (`Job`, `Company`, `User`, etc.).
*   Mock API Routes created for core entities (jobs, projects, companies).
*   Frontend components (`app/jobs/[id]/page.tsx`, `app/explore/page.tsx`) refactored to fetch data from API routes.
*   Job Application API (`POST /api/applications`) and frontend form (`app/jobs/[id]/apply/page.tsx`) implemented.
*   Build configurations in `next.config.mjs` updated to enforce ESLint and TypeScript checks (manual verification of build/lint status pending due to tool limitations).
*   NextAuth.js setup for credentials-based authentication:
    *   Assumed installation of `next-auth`.
    *   Created `lib/inMemoryStore.ts` for temporary user data.
    *   Implemented API routes for auth (`app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`) and registration (`app/api/auth/register/route.ts`) using the in-memory store (password hashing not yet implemented).
    *   Created UI pages for Signup (`/auth/signup`) and Login (`/auth/login`).
    *   Integrated `SessionProvider` in `app/layout.tsx`.
    *   Updated `components/header.tsx` for dynamic session display and login/logout.
*   User Profile Management Foundation:
    *   Expanded `User`, `Experience`, and `Education` interfaces in `lib/types.ts`.
    *   Updated `lib/inMemoryStore.ts` for expanded user profiles and added `updateUserProfile`.
    *   Adjusted registration API for new user profile structure.
    *   Created API routes `GET /api/users/[userId]` and `PUT /api/users/[userId]` for profile data.
    *   Developed Profile Page (`app/profile/[userId]/page.tsx`) for displaying user data.
    *   Developed Edit Profile Page (`app/profile/edit/page.tsx`) for basic profile info editing.
    *   Updated header link to point to the authenticated user's dynamic profile page.
*   Route Protection with Middleware:
    *   Implemented `middleware.ts` to protect routes like `/feed`, `/profile/*`, `/explore`, redirecting unauthenticated users to login.
    *   Authenticated users accessing login/signup pages are redirected to `/feed`.
*   Replaced redirect in `app/page.tsx` with a new public landing page featuring a welcome message and Sign Up/Log In CTAs.

## Database Setup (Prisma with SQLite)

*   Prisma ORM has been initialized for the project (simulated due to tool limitations with `pnpm add` and `npx prisma init`).
*   Uses SQLite (`file:./dev.db`) for local development, as configured in `prisma/schema.prisma` and `.env`.
*   Prisma CLI and `@prisma/client` assumed to be installed.
*   `.env` file created for `DATABASE_URL` (and confirmed to be in `.gitignore`).
*   SQLite database files (`prisma/dev.db*`) added to `.gitignore`.

## Phase 1: Core Authentication & User Foundation - Complete (Initial Pass)

The initial pass of Phase 1 is now complete. Key functionalities include:
- Robust (credentials-based) authentication setup with NextAuth.js.
- User registration and login.
- In-memory data store for users and profiles (development only - Prisma setup initiated for DB transition).
- User profile management (viewing and basic editing of own profile).
- Route protection for authenticated areas using middleware.
- A public landing page for unauthenticated users.
- Initialized Prisma with SQLite for local database.
- Defined data models (User, Company, Job, Post, JobApplication, Experience, Education, PasswordResetToken) in `prisma/schema.prisma` including relations. Array-like fields are defined as `Json` type for SQLite compatibility.

**Important Next Steps for Production-Ready Auth & Profile:**
- Implement password hashing for user credentials.
- Transition from in-memory store to a persistent database using Prisma.
- Consider adding OAuth providers (Google, LinkedIn).
- Implement profile picture file uploads.
- Enhance profile editing (e.g., for experience and education arrays).
- Thorough testing of all authentication and profile flows.
- Manually run `pnpm add -D prisma`, `pnpm add @prisma/client`, and `npx prisma init` if not already effectively completed (tool environment had issues).
- Manually run `pnpm run lint` and `pnpm run build` in a local development environment to identify and fix any ESLint or TypeScript errors.

## Phase 2: Core Content & Interaction

**Accomplished:**
*   Defined `Post` interface in `lib/types.ts` (including fields for text content, optional media URLs, author information, timestamps, and like/comment counts).
*   Updated `lib/inMemoryStore.ts` to manage `Post` objects, including `addPost` (prepends to array for chronological order), `getPosts`, and `findPostById` functions.

**Next Steps:**
*   Run initial Prisma migration (`npx prisma migrate dev --name init`) to create database schema based on `prisma/schema.prisma` and generate Prisma Client.
*   Implement API endpoints for creating posts (`POST /api/posts`) and reading posts (`GET /api/posts`), now using Prisma Client to interact with the database.
*   Develop a UI component for creating new posts.
*   Develop the main feed page (`/feed`) to display posts from the API (via Prisma).
*   Implement functionality for liking and commenting on posts (API and UI, using Prisma).
