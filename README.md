# 100 Networks Project Status

**CRITICAL SETUP REQUIRED:** Please follow the instructions in `GIT_MERGE_AND_SETUP_GUIDE.md` to update your local branch with the Auth.js v5 migration and set up your database **before proceeding with further development or expecting the application to run correctly.**

## Project Status & Next Steps

Here's a summary of what has been accomplished so far:

*   Initial project analysis completed.
*   Project cleanup (backup files removed, CSS consolidated).
*   ThemeProvider integrated for theme management.
*   Core TypeScript Data Models defined (`Job`, `Company`, `User`, etc.).
*   Mock API Routes created for core entities (jobs, projects, companies).
*   Frontend components (`app/jobs/[id]/page.tsx`, `app/explore/page.tsx`) refactored to fetch data from API routes.
*   Job Application API (`POST /api/applications`) and frontend form (`app/jobs/[id]/apply/page.tsx`) implemented.
*   Build configurations in `next.config.mjs` updated to enforce ESLint and TypeScript checks (manual verification of build/lint status pending due to tool limitations).
*   User Profile Management Foundation:
    *   Expanded `User`, `Experience`, and `Education` interfaces in `lib/types.ts`.
    *   Developed Profile Page (`app/profile/[userId]/page.tsx`) for displaying user data.
    *   Developed Edit Profile Page (`app/profile/edit/page.tsx`) for basic profile info editing.
    *   Updated header link to point to the authenticated user's dynamic profile page.
*   Route Protection with Middleware:
    *   Implemented `middleware.ts` to protect routes like `/feed`, `/profile/*`, `/explore`, redirecting unauthenticated users to login.
    *   Authenticated users accessing login/signup pages are redirected to `/feed`.
*   Replaced redirect in `app/page.tsx` with a new public landing page.

## Database Setup (Prisma with SQLite)

*   Prisma ORM has been initialized for the project.
*   Uses SQLite (`file:./dev.db`) for local development.
*   Prisma CLI and `@prisma/client` assumed to be installed.
*   `.env` file created for `DATABASE_URL`.
*   SQLite database files (`prisma/dev.db*`) added to `.gitignore`.

## Phase 1: Core Authentication & User Foundation - Complete (Pending Auth.js v5 Full Test)

The initial pass of Phase 1, focusing on setting up core authentication and user structures, is largely complete. The recent migration to Auth.js v5 needs thorough testing. Key functionalities include:
- User registration and login, with password hashing (`bcryptjs`) and database persistence (Prisma).
- User profile management (viewing and basic editing of own profile), with APIs using Prisma.
- Route protection for authenticated areas using middleware.
- A public landing page for unauthenticated users.
- Initialized Prisma with SQLite for local database.
- Defined data models in `prisma/schema.prisma`.
- Successfully ran initial Prisma migration creating SQLite database schema and generating Prisma Client (with user assistance for manual steps).
- Created a reusable Prisma Client instance in `lib/prisma.ts`.
- Refactored registration API (`/api/auth/register`) to use Prisma and `bcryptjs`.
- Implemented API endpoint `POST /api/auth/forgot-password` to handle password reset requests.
- Implemented API endpoint `POST /api/auth/reset-password` to validate reset tokens and update user passwords.
- Connected `forgot-password` and `reset-password` UI pages.
- The `lib/inMemoryStore.ts` is now being phased out for user and auth-related data.

**NextAuth.js v4 to Auth.js v5 Migration:**
*   Uninstalled `next-auth` (v4) and installed `next-auth@beta` (v5) and `@auth/prisma-adapter` (assumed successful manual install by user due to tool limitations).
*   Deleted old API route `app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`.
    *   Created new configuration files: `auth.config.ts` (with `CredentialsProvider` using Prisma, `PrismaAdapter` configured, JWT session strategy, and callbacks) and `auth.ts` (exporting `handlers`, `auth`, `signIn`, `signOut`).
*   Created new API route `app/api/auth/[...auth]/route.ts` using the new handlers.
    *   Updated `.env` requirements: `AUTH_SECRET` (replaces `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`), `AUTH_URL` (recommended, e.g., `http://localhost:3000`), and `DATABASE_URL`. `NEXTAUTH_URL` can be kept for now or replaced by `AUTH_URL`.
    *   Removed temporary plain text password check from `authorize` function in `auth.config.ts`, relying on `bcryptjs.compare`.
    *   **Note:** `SessionProvider` import in `app/layout.tsx` and `useSession`/`signIn`/`signOut` imports in client components still use `next-auth/react`. These may need to be updated based on Auth.js v5 best practices after initial testing.

**Important Next Steps for Production-Ready Auth & Profile (Post-Phase 1 & 2):**
- Transition all remaining API routes using `lib/inMemoryStore.ts` (e.g., posts, jobs, applications) to use Prisma Client.
- Implement more granular authorization for sensitive operations.
- Consider adding OAuth providers (Google, LinkedIn) via `auth.config.ts`.
- Implement profile picture file uploads.
- Enhance profile editing (e.g., for experience and education arrays using Prisma relations).
- Thorough testing of all authentication (v5), profile, and core entity management flows with the database.
- Manually run `pnpm run lint` and `pnpm run build` in a local development environment to identify and fix any ESLint or TypeScript errors.

## Phase 2: Core Content & Interaction

**Accomplished:**
*   Defined `Post` interface in `lib/types.ts`.
*   Updated `lib/inMemoryStore.ts` to manage `Post` objects (this will be fully replaced by Prisma for posts).
*   Implemented API endpoint `POST /api/posts` for creating new posts.
*   Implemented API endpoint `GET /api/posts` for retrieving all posts.
*   Connected `app/feed/page.tsx` UI to Post APIs (create/display text posts).
*   Implemented API endpoints `GET /api/posts/:postId`, `PUT /api/posts/:postId`, `DELETE /api/posts/:postId`.
*   Added Edit/Delete UI for posts in feed, with functional delete.
*   Verified Like/Comment count display and placeholder buttons in feed.
*   Defined `Like` model in `prisma/schema.prisma`.

**Next Steps:**
1.  **Complete Auth.js v5 Migration & Testing:**
    *   **Thoroughly test login, logout, and registration with the new Auth.js v5 setup.**
    *   Verify session handling in client components (`useSession` from `next-auth/react` or equivalent from `auth.ts`).
    *   Update `signIn` and `signOut` usage in client components if necessary (check if they should be imported from `auth.ts` or `next-auth/react`).
    *   **Follow `GIT_MERGE_AND_SETUP_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions on merging, cleaning the environment, installing dependencies, and running the initial Prisma migration.**
    *   Thoroughly test login, logout, and registration with the new Auth.js v5 setup.
    *   Verify session handling in client components (`useSession` from `next-auth/react` or equivalent from `auth.ts`).
    *   Update `signIn` and `signOut` usage in client components if necessary.
    *   Resolve any errors arising from the v5 migration, particularly the "React Context is unavailable" error if it persists.
2.  **Manual Prisma Migration for Likes (After Dev Server is Stable):** Run `npx prisma migrate dev --name add-like-model`.
3.  **Implement 'Like' functionality (API & UI) (once auth is stable and Like migration is done).**
4.  Implement functionality for commenting on posts (API and UI, using Prisma).
5.  Refactor Job and Freelance Project APIs to use Prisma.
6.  Enhance Post creation UI to handle actual image uploads.

## Troubleshooting / Known Issues
*   **React Context in Server Components:** This error was the primary driver for the Auth.js v5 migration attempt. Debugging steps included simplifying `app/page.tsx` and `app/layout.tsx` by commenting out providers. The error was resolved when `SessionProvider` and `HeaderWrapper` were both removed. Further testing is needed with the new Auth.js v5 structure. The `auth.ts` file now exports `auth` which can be used in Server Components to get session data, potentially reducing reliance on `useSession` in some places.
*   **Tooling Limitations:** Automated execution of `pnpm` commands and `npx prisma` commands has been unreliable. These steps often require manual execution.
*   **Auth.js v5 Beta:** As v5 is in beta, some APIs or import paths might change. Refer to official Auth.js documentation for the latest. `@auth/prisma-adapter` is now configured in `auth.config.ts`; its installation by the user needs to be confirmed.
