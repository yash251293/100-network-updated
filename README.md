# 100 Networks Project Status

## Project Status & Next Steps

Here's a summary of what has been accomplished so far:

*   Initial project analysis completed:
    *   Reviewed `package.json`, `next.config.mjs`, and `tsconfig.json`.
    *   Explored the directory structure.
    *   Consolidated global CSS files (`app/globals.css`).
*   Project cleanup:
    *   Removed `.bak` files from `app/auth/`.
*   ThemeProvider integrated:
    *   `ThemeProvider` from `next-themes` (via `components/theme-provider.tsx`) is now wrapping the application layout in `app/layout.tsx` for light/dark mode management.
*   TypeScript Data Models:
    *   Core data interfaces (`Job`, `Company`, `FreelanceProject`, `User`, `JobApplication`) defined in `lib/types.ts`.
*   Mock API Routes:
    *   Basic API routes created under `app/api/` for:
        *   `jobs` (listing and detail)
        *   `freelance-projects` (listing and detail)
        *   `companies` (listing and detail)
    *   These routes currently serve mock/sample data conforming to the interfaces in `lib/types.ts`.
*   Refactored `app/jobs/[id]/page.tsx` to fetch data from `/api/jobs/:id`.
*   Refactored `app/explore/page.tsx` to fetch data for jobs, freelance projects, and companies from their respective API routes, including loading and error states.
*   Created API route `POST /api/applications` to receive job application data (currently stores in memory and logs).
*   Refactored/Implemented the job application page (`app/jobs/[id]/apply/page.tsx`) to submit application data to `POST /api/applications` and handle responses.
*   Re-enabled ESLint and TypeScript error checks during builds in `next.config.mjs`.
*   Attempted `pnpm run lint` and `pnpm run build`, but execution was inconclusive due to environment limitations. Manual verification of linting and build status is required.

### Next Steps:

1.  Manually run `pnpm run lint` and `pnpm run build` in a local development environment to identify and fix any ESLint or TypeScript errors.
2.  Once all checks pass, proceed to submit the changes.
