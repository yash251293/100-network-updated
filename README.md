# 100 Networks Project Status

## Project Status & Next Steps

Here's a summary of what has been accomplished so far:

*   Initial project analysis completed.
*   Project cleanup (backup files removed, CSS consolidated).
*   ThemeProvider integrated for theme management.
*   Core TypeScript Data Models defined (`Job`, `Company`, `User`, etc.).
*   Mock API Routes created for core entities (jobs, projects, companies).
*   Frontend components (`app/jobs/[id]/page.tsx`, `app/explore/page.tsx`) refactored to fetch data from API routes.
*   Job Application API (`POST /api/applications`) and frontend form (`app/jobs/[id]/apply/page.tsx`) implemented.
*   Build configurations in `next.config.mjs` updated to enforce ESLint and TypeScript checks (manual verification of build/lint status pending due to tool limitations).
*   NextAuth.js setup for credentials-based authentication:
    *   Assumed installation of `next-auth` and `bcryptjs`.
    *   Implemented API routes for auth (`app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`) and registration (`app/api/auth/register/route.ts`).
    *   Created UI pages for Signup (`/auth/signup`) and Login (`/auth/login`).
    *   Integrated `SessionProvider` in `app/layout.tsx`.
    *   Updated `components/header.tsx` for dynamic session display and login/logout.
*   User Profile Management Foundation:
    *   Expanded `User`, `Experience`, and `Education` interfaces in `lib/types.ts`.
    *   Developed Profile Page (`app/profile/[userId]/page.tsx`) for displaying user data.
    *   Developed Edit Profile Page (`app/profile/edit/page.tsx`) for basic profile info editing.
    *   Updated header link to point to the authenticated user's dynamic profile page.
*   Route Protection with Middleware:
    *   Implemented `middleware.ts` to protect routes like `/feed`, `/profile/*`, `/explore`, redirecting unauthenticated users to login.
    *   Authenticated users accessing login/signup pages are redirected to `/feed`.
*   Replaced redirect in `app/page.tsx` with a new public landing page.

## Database Setup (Prisma with SQLite)

*   Prisma ORM has been initialized for the project.
*   Uses SQLite (`file:./dev.db`) for local development.
*   Prisma CLI and `@prisma/client` assumed to be installed.
*   `.env` file created for `DATABASE_URL`.
*   SQLite database files (`prisma/dev.db*`) added to `.gitignore`.

## Phase 1: Core Authentication & User Foundation - Complete

The initial pass of Phase 1 is now complete. Key functionalities include:
- Robust (credentials-based) authentication setup with NextAuth.js.
- User registration and login, with password hashing (`bcryptjs`) and database persistence (Prisma).
- User profile management (viewing and basic editing of own profile), with APIs using Prisma.
- Route protection for authenticated areas using middleware.
- A public landing page for unauthenticated users.
- Initialized Prisma with SQLite for local database.
- Defined data models in `prisma/schema.prisma`.
- Successfully ran initial Prisma migration creating SQLite database schema and generating Prisma Client (with user assistance for manual steps).
- Created a reusable Prisma Client instance in `lib/prisma.ts`.
- Refactored registration API (`/api/auth/register`) to use Prisma and `bcryptjs`.
- Refactored NextAuth.js CredentialsProvider in `/api/auth/[...nextauth]` to use Prisma for user lookup and `bcryptjs` for password verification.
- Refactored User Profile APIs (`GET /api/users/[userId]`, `PUT /api/users/[userId]`) to use Prisma.
- Implemented basic CRUD APIs for Companies (`/api/companies`, `/api/companies/[id]`) using Prisma. (Note: `PUT` for companies currently allows any authenticated user to update; more granular authorization needed for production).
- Implemented API endpoint `POST /api/auth/forgot-password` to handle password reset requests (generates token, stores hash in DB, simulates email).
- Implemented API endpoint `POST /api/auth/reset-password` to validate reset tokens (hashed, checked against DB) and update user passwords with bcryptjs.
- Connected `forgot-password` (`app/auth/forgot-password/page.tsx`) and `reset-password` (`app/auth/reset-password/page.tsx`) UI pages to their respective backend API endpoints.
- The `lib/inMemoryStore.ts` is now being phased out, with User, Company, and PasswordResetToken data managed by Prisma. It may still hold data for Posts, Jobs, etc., until those are migrated.

**Important Next Steps for Production-Ready System (Post-Phase 1 & 2):**
- Transition all remaining API routes using `lib/inMemoryStore.ts` (e.g., posts, jobs, applications) to use Prisma Client.
- Implement more granular authorization for sensitive operations (e.g., company updates, job postings).
- Consider adding OAuth providers (Google, LinkedIn).
- Implement profile picture file uploads.
- Enhance profile editing (e.g., for experience and education arrays using Prisma relations).
- Thorough testing of all authentication, profile, and core entity management flows with the database.
- Manually run `pnpm run lint` and `pnpm run build` in a local development environment to identify and fix any ESLint or TypeScript errors.

## Phase 2: Core Content & Interaction

**Accomplished:**
*   Defined `Post` interface in `lib/types.ts`.
*   Updated `lib/inMemoryStore.ts` to manage `Post` objects (this will be fully replaced by Prisma for posts).
*   Implemented API endpoint `POST /api/posts` for creating new posts, linking to authenticated user. Data stored via Prisma.
*   Implemented API endpoint `GET /api/posts` for retrieving all posts (ordered by newest first) from the database via Prisma.
*   Connected `app/feed/page.tsx` UI to Post APIs: enabled creating text posts (image upload UI present but not functional for backend storage yet) and displaying a dynamic feed of posts from the database.
*   Implemented API endpoint `GET /api/posts/:postId` for retrieving a single post by its ID using Prisma.
*   Implemented API endpoint `PUT /api/posts/:postId` for updating authenticated user's own posts using Prisma.
*   Implemented API endpoint `DELETE /api/posts/:postId` for authenticated users to delete their own posts using Prisma.
*   Added Edit and Delete buttons/icons to posts in the feed (`app/feed/page.tsx`) for authors of the posts.
*   Implemented client-side logic for deleting posts (with confirmation) by calling `DELETE /api/posts/:postId` and refreshing the feed.
*   Edit button for posts currently navigates to a placeholder route (`/posts/:postId/edit`).
*   Verified and ensured Like & Comment counts are displayed for each post in the feed.
*   Confirmed placeholder Like & Comment buttons/icons are present on each post (functionality deferred).
*   Defined `Like` model in `prisma/schema.prisma` and added `likes` relation to `Post` model.

**Next Steps:**
1.  **Manual Prisma Migration Required:** Run `npx prisma migrate dev --name add-like-model` to apply the new `Like` model to the database and regenerate Prisma Client. This is required before implementing Like API endpoints.
2.  **Implement 'Like' functionality (API):**
    *   Create API endpoints:
        *   `POST /api/posts/[postId]/like` (to like a post).
        *   `DELETE /api/posts/[postId]/like` (to unlike a post).
    *   These endpoints will create/delete `Like` records in Prisma and update the `likesCount` on the `Post` model using a transaction.
3.  **Implement 'Like' functionality (UI):**
    *   Update the UI in `app/feed/page.tsx` to call these new Like/Unlike APIs.
    *   Dynamically update the like button's appearance (e.g., filled/unfilled heart) and the `likesCount` based on user interaction and API response.
4.  Implement functionality for commenting on posts (API and UI, using Prisma).
5.  Refactor Job and Freelance Project APIs to use Prisma.
6.  Enhance Post creation UI to handle actual image uploads (backend and frontend).
