# PostgreSQL Connection URL
# This is used by the application to connect to your PostgreSQL database.
# Copy this file to .env.local and replace with your actual credentials.
#
# Format: postgresql://username:password@host:port/database_name
#
# Example for local development using the defaults from setup_postgres_dev.sh:
POSTGRES_URL="postgresql://app_user:app_password@localhost:5432/app_dev_db"

# JWT Secret Key
# This is used to sign and verify JSON Web Tokens for authentication.
# It should be a long, random, and secret string.
# Generate a strong secret for your .env.local file.
# Example generation (in a Node.js console): require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex')
JWT_SECRET="your_super_secret_jwt_key_here_please_change_me_in_env_local"

# Other application-specific environment variables can be added below.
# For example:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL="http://localhost:3000/api"

# Note for Next.js:
# - Variables prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_ are exposed to the browser.
# - Variables without NEXT_PUBLIC_ are only available on the server-side.
# - .env.local is the standard file for local overrides and is ignored by Git.
# - Other environments (like .env.production) can also be used. See Next.js documentation.
